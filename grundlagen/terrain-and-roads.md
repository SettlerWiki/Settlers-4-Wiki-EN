## Terrain types

There are several terrain types in Settlers, most of which have unique properties.This is a list of all important terrain types:

### Grass

The default surface area of the map. All civilizations can build here. Supports roads, grain and most types of mana plants.

### Dark Grass

An uncommon variant of grass which does not appear on random maps. Unlike normal grass, this type does not support roads, making it desirable for wood production.

### Grass island

Similar to grass with some aesthetic differences approaching swamp.

### Dusty path

Created when carriers repeatedly walk over grass. Carriers walk slightly faster (8 ticks per tile rather than the default 9). Blocks trees from being planted, but not grain.

### Paved Road

Created when carriers repeatedly walk over dusty paths. Accelerates carriers even further (7 ticks per tile). Blocks trees from being planted, but not grain.

### Desert

Only the mayans and trojans can build here. It's primarmy purpose is for agave production by the mayans. Mayan and trojan foresters can also cultivate palm trees here. Viking priests can turn desert into grass using the shortcut spell. Does not support roads.

### Rock

Can be surveyed by geologists, construction restricted to mines. Does not support roads.

### Swamp

Impassable terrain. Roman priests can turn swamp into grass using the shortcut spell.

### Mud

Passable terrain that does not support roads. Only vikings and trojans can build here. Trojan priests can turn grass into mud using the shortcut spell.

### Snow / Lava

Found on the peaks of mountains. Impassable terrain which can be cleared using the shortcut spell. Rock that is covered by snow never contains resources!

### Beach

Dividing terrain between grass and water. All civilizations can build here. Does not support roads or any plants.
